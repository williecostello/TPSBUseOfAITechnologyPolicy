# Toronto Police Services Board's Use of Artificial Intelligence Technology Policy

A repo to track the changes between the original draft and revised version of the Toronto Police Services Board's policy on the Use of Artificial Intelligence Technology.

To see these changes, view the history of the `policy.md` file.

The original PDFs of the draft and revised policies were downloaded for the Toronto Police Service Board's website, at the following links:

- [Draft Policy](https://tpsb.ca/images/consultations/AI/Use_of_AI_Technology_Policy_-_DRAFT_-_20211108_Public_Consultation.pdf)
- [Revised (Proposed) Policy](https://tpsb.ca/jdownloads-categories?task=download.send&id=718&catid=32&m=0)

The PDF files have also been included in this repo.

`policy.md` was created by converting these PDFs to Markdown using this [PDF to Markdown Converter](https://pdf2md.morethan.io/). The conversion is not perfect, but is consistent across the two documents, and is good enough for viewing the diffs.
